Objective: dataset about water pumps (functional, functional needs repair etc etc)

Task: Build ML model predicting water pump status


- Tasks: 

-Evaluate different machine learning models

- Looki into hyper parameter optimisation of those models


Resources:

- Scikit-learn library (additionall pandas and numpy)

Part 1:

Tasks:

- Dealing with categorical features. (especially some with high cardinality)

	- Consider three types of encoding (OneHotEncoder, Ordinal Encoder and TargetEncoder)

- Dealing with missing values.

- Scaling numerical values.
	
	- Consider (No Scaling, StandardScaler)

- Dealing with datetime features.

- Study five different ML model families:

LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, HistGradientBoostingClassifier and MLPClassifier
(do 5-fold  cross validation to make things statistically sound)
